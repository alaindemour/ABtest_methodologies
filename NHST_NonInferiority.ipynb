    "When launching new web/mobile features:\n",
    "- **Limited traffic allocation**: New features get only 2-5% of traffic to minimize risk\n",
    "- **Small sample sizes**: Each variant may only see hundreds or low thousands of users\n",
    "- **Need for speed**: We need fast decisions to iterate or scale\n",

    "With our real experiment data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NHST conclusion**: \"Cannot determine if variant is non-inferior. p-value is 45%, far too high. Need much more data. Come back in a few weeks.\"\n",
    "- **Business impact**: Product team blocked, cannot iterate, cannot scale successful features\n",
    "- **Root cause**: NHST's mathematical framework requires large samples to overcome uncertainty\n",
