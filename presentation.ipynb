    "# From Manual Bayesian AB Tests to Automated Thompson Samplings\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents how we analyze our passkey launch with a Bayesian AB test Analysis then suggest how we could  systematize and automate our AB Test with automated verison of Bayesian technque called Thomspson Sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Presentation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classical statistics and Bayesian Statisic**: Null Hypothesis Signficance Testing vs. Prior Belief to Posterior Belief quantification\n",
    "\n",
    "Brief explnation contrasting NHST $p(D | \\theta)$ vs. Bayesian p (\\theta |D), explaining that the business decision rule is baked in NHST while in Bayesian the decision rule is outisde the probability computation\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Why Bayesian is Better for CX or pricing AB Tests**: in this presenetation we will focus business and techncial reasons but there are some philosophical ones worth mentionning see ET Jaynes and \"the language of science\". \n",
    "\n",
    "knowns isue with NHST with small samples, p-value hacking, unbalanced samples, updatability, and the general them of the \"crisi of replicability\", whiel Baeysian excel tehre.\n",
    "But also explnaing that this matter only when one work with smaller sample and a business need to make decision quickly, once we have million of data points all this becomes moot.\n",
    "Add some \"political note that In January 2026, the FDA issued a landmark draft guidance titled \"Use of Bayesian Methodology in Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biological Products,\" marking a significant shift in how the agency approaches drug approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Our firt test : Non Inferiotity **: NHST provdies no answer our Bayesia test did based on a small sample\n",
    "4. **Select Best Variant**: Choose the winning variant with probability\n",
    "5. **Pratical issues at large corporate envirmment in iterating the AB testing process rapdily**:  Release Engineering, Approvals\n",
    "   \n",
    "Explain that if AB testis conducted manually , even after a insight and decisio is made that  a variant is better, it might take month to make the change, wit a real world example when the decision was made early November but classi release freeze around black friday, bug in the custom AB testing traffic splitter, legal needed to review the decision etc.. push the release of the winning variant into Janunaru. Segway to the solution automated Thomson sampling\n",
