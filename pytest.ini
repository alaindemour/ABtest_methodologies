# Pytest configuration for ABtest_methodologies
#
# Why this file exists:
# - The bayesian/utils.py module has functions named "test_non_inferiority_*"
# - These are IMPLEMENTATION functions, not test functions
# - Without configuration, pytest collects them as tests and fails
# - This config tells pytest to ONLY look in the tests/ directory

# Test discovery: Only search in tests/ directory
testpaths = tests

# Test file patterns: Files that contain tests
python_files = test_*.py

# Test class patterns: Classes that contain tests
python_classes = Test*

# Test function patterns: Functions that are tests
python_functions = test_*

# Minimum Python version required
minversion = 6.0
