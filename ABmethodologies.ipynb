    "# Exec Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents both Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) and Bayesian Methodologies, goes into a lot of details about the math and the methodological considerations which make a Bayesian approach a better fit for web/mobile AB tests. But if you want to skip the math and just get the benefits, go to the end of the notebook and use the Python functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `test_non_inferiority()` - Verify new features don't degrade experience\n",
    "2. `select_best_variant()` - Choose winning variant with probability\n",
    "\n",
    "which should be sufficient to support a CX analysis with 3 variants and a control. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When launching new web or mobile features, engineering teams face a common dilemma:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited traffic allocation**: At launch new features get only 2-5% of traffic to minimize risk\n",
    "- **Multiple variants**: Design teams often propose 3-5 different implementations\n",
    "- **Small sample sizes**: At launch because of controlled releases, each variant may only see hundreds or low thousands of users\n",
    "- **Need for speed**: We need fast decisions on which variants are best to iterate or scale\n",
    "- **Less than perfect launch logistics** because of bugs or misconfiguration the allocation between variants and control may not be what was planned i.e. some samples may be too large or too small or even missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional NHST fails here**: With small, unbalanced samples (e.g., 7,000 control vs. 150 per variant), statistical tests either:\n",
    "- Fail to reach significance (underpowered, β > 0.8, meaning power < 20%)\n",
    "- Require weeks of data collection\n",
    "- Is unwieldy to compare more than 2 variants at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Bayesian Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian methods excel precisely where NHST struggles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Works with Small Samples**\n",
    "- Incorporates prior knowledge (historical conversion rates)\n",
    "- Updates beliefs incrementally as data arrives\n",
    "- Provides meaningful conclusions even with n=150 per variant\n",
    "- No arbitrary \"minimum sample size\" requirement to reach statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Handles Unbalanced Allocation Naturally**\n",
    "- 90% control, 10% variants? No problem.\n",
    "- Each variant can have different sample sizes\n",
    "- No need for equal allocation or \"balanced designs\"\n",
    "- Protects existing user experience while testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Scales to Many Variants Effortlessly**\n",
    "- Compare 3, 5, 10, or 100 variants simultaneously\n",
    "- Single coherent analysis—no multiple comparison penalties\n",
    "- Direct answer: P(A is best) = 31%, P(B is best) = 47%, P(C is best) = 22%\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Provides Actionable Probabilities**\n",
    "- NHST says: \"Cannot reject H₀\" , not directly actionable, say if one has idea of the cost of a bad decision there is no real way to compute an expected value for what can be seen as a bet on being right or wrong.\n",
    "- Bayesian says: \"47% chance B is best, 22% it's worse than control\" (actionable, expected value can be computed, can directly feed into a decision algorithm)\n",
    "- Direct business decision: Deploy B with quantified risk\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Allows Continuous Monitoring**\n",
    "- Can check results anytime without \"p-hacking\" concerns\n",
    "- Smoothly and incrementally update posterior probability as new data arrives\n",
    "- Stop early if clear winner emerges, or rebalance incrementally (See multi armed bandits strategies)\n",
    "- Continue if more certainty needed—mathematically rigorous\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Traditional NHST | Bayesian Approach |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| Small samples | Underpowered, inconclusive | Works well with prior knowledge |\n",
    "| Unbalanced allocation | Loses efficiency | No problem |\n",
    "| Multiple variants | Complex corrections needed | Natural single analysis |\n",
    "| Interpretation | p-value (hard to explain) | Probability (intuitive) |\n",

    "## Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "For modern product development with:\n",
    "- **Rapid iteration cycles**\n",
    "- **bugs/misconfiguration in the traffic splitters**\n",
    "- **Risk-averse traffic allocation**\n",
    "- **Multiple design options**\n",
    "- **Small initial samples**\n",

    "**Bayesian methods provide:**\n",
    "- Faster decisions (days vs. weeks)\n",
    "- Better use of limited data\n",
    "- Clear, business-friendly outputs\n",
    "- Quantified confidence for risk management\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables product teams to launch confidently, iterate quickly, and scale successful features—all while protecting the existing user experience.\n",

    "1. `test_non_inferiority()` - Verify new features don't degrade experience\n",
    "2. `select_best_variant()` - Choose winning variant with probability\n",

    "When evaluating new user experiences (UX) — such as launching **passkeys** and measuring their impact on abandonment rates — our CX team has provided us with 3 variants $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$ for the passkey creation experience. After launch we need to make sure that adding passkey creation does not degrade the success rate of our current CX significantly by comparing each variant to a control group that will remain on our legacy pages, then we have to decide which of the variants performs best.\n",

Without P(H₀ | data), we cannot compute expected values for decision-making—if deploying a bad variant costs $100k and a good one gains $50k, NHST provides no framework to quantify the expected value of the decision\n",

    "NHST also has a notion of Confidence Interval but it is not what most people think it means. It does not say anything about the hypothesis or whether the observed value is close to the truth, or whether rejecting H0 is true or not. It is computed without using any of the hypotheses; it is just using the \"plugged in\" standard deviation SE (derived from the observation, with all the caveats we discussed) and says: if we repeated the experiment many times and constructed an interval each time using this procedure, 95% of those intervals would contain the true parameter value. The parameter is fixed; the interval is random across repeated experiments. Not useful to make any decisions directly. Some people use it indirectly by looking for overlaps between the interval and some key values, but that's just another way to do the p-value analysis as above, or \"picking the best variant\" below. The p-value computation is the same computation really and the mainstream way of doing it for NHST practitioners.\n",

    "> *Which variant is most likely the best?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:**\n",
    "1. Compute the **posterior Beta distribution** for each variant using its prior and observed data.  \n",
    "2. Draw a large number of samples (e.g., 100k) from each posterior.  \n",
    "3. For each simulated draw, identify which variant has the highest conversion rate.  \n",
    "4. Report the probabilities:  \n",
    "   $$P(A \\text{ is best}),\\; P(B \\text{ is best}),\\; P(C \\text{ is best}), \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "-  **Direct answer:** “Variant B is best with 88.8% probability.”  \n",
    "-  **Single coherent analysis:** no need for multiple-comparison corrections.  \n",
    "-  **Scales naturally:** works the same way for 3, 5, 10, or 100 variants.  \n",
    "-  **Quantifies uncertainty:** not just yes/no; can report $P(B>A)$, $P(B>A \\;\\&\\; B>C)$, etc.  \n",
    "-  **Flexible:** easily integrates prior knowledge and business context.  \n",
    "-  **Business-friendly:** simple to factor in risk, cost, and implementation difficulty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:**  \n",
    "Bayesian analysis gives a **probability each variant is best** — a direct, interpretable metric that scales cleanly and supports real-world decision making.\n"
